## General info
**To Do List** is an app that helps with organizing tasks. You may list as many tasks as you wish and tick boxes when they are done or remove them by clicking on the ðŸ—‘ button.

The app was made during my participation in the [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/frontend-developer/) frontend developer course.
